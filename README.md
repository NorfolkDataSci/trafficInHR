# Traffic in HR Analysis
Analysis of traffic patterns in HR
## Overview
You hate the traffic in HR? Me too! Traffic is a major issue in the Hampton Roads Metro. What effects does traffic have on our quality of lives? property values? and decisions related to work and life?
## Goals
Using data analysis, we may be able to make an impact on where to put new infrastructure to help the region. A finished product may take many forms: a study on the impacts on traffic on <insert interesting variable here>, recommendations of where to put new roads, new shortest route which may not be highlighted in google maps, social media’s sentiment towards the traffic in HR, a calculation on marginal benefit derived from new road construction
## Project Roadmap
TBD
## Data Source
Just getting started – as you find new data sources please share. I will be updating over the next several weeks. 
## Sample Scripts
Here is one script on the google API which may help one get started
